# Motion-Based-Home-Automation-System
A motion-based home automation system that controls appliances using a PIR sensor. When motion is detected, the microcontroller automatically switches on devices like lights or fans and turns them off after inactivity. This reduces energy waste, offers convenience, and works well in homes, offices, corridors, washrooms, and parking areas.
